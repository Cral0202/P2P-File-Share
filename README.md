**Receiving files requires a public IP address. It will not work if you are behind CG-NAT. However, you can still
send files without a public IP address.**

---

- All data is sent encrypted over a TLS connection.

- To allow file receiving, open a port on your network.
  No ports need to be opened to send files.

- To connect to someone, add them as a contact and make sure they’ve added you as well.
  Then you can select them and press "Connect".
  You can then select a file and click "Send".
  You will be notified if the recipient rejects the file, or receives it.

- To receive files, click the "Enable Receiving" button. When a file is sent to you, you can choose to either receive or reject it.
  Received files are placed in your "Downloads" folder.

- To send folders, package them first (e.g., ZIP), then send them as a regular file.

If you want to build an executable: `pyinstaller main.spec`
